# The Rack is a modular interface to handle web requests.
# Rack interface abstracts away the handling of HTTP requests and responses 
# into a single, simple call method (invoked by an HTTP request) that passes 
# in a hash of environment variables and return an array that contains:
# - The HTTP response code
# - environment hash, which in most cases the hash of headers of http response
# - The response body, which must respond to each
# 
# Classes that satisfy Rackâ€™s call interface can be chained together as filters. 
# Rack itself includes a number of useful filter classes that do things such as 
# logging and exception handling.
