# First, write an iterator called each, which returns the elements of your
# collection in turn.
# Then, mix in Enumerable , and suddenly your class supports things such as
# map, include?, and find_all?.
# If the objects in your collection implement meaningful ordering semantics
# using the <=> method, youâ€™ll also get methods such as min, max, and sort.

  def each
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a <= @max do
      yield a
      a, b = b, a + b
