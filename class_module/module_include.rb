# Module provides code reuse with namespace separation.
# This type of code reuse doesn't consume class inheritance.
# It is called 'mixin', since module doesn't have instance, but gets
# mixed into target instance via 'include' keyword.
#
# The Ruby include statement simply makes a reference to a named module.
# If that module is in a separate file, you should use require (or
# its less commonly used cousin, load) to drag that file in before
# using include.
#
# The Ruby include does not simply copy the moduleâ€™s instance methods
# into the class. Instead, it makes a reference from the class
# to the included module.
#
# Mixed in modules <em>effectively</em> behaves as superclasses.
#
#

module MyModule
  # available to target instance when included
  CONSTANT_VAR1 = 'ok, i am number 1'
  CONSTANT_VAR2 = 'ok, i am number 2'

  def hello_module
    puts 'instance hello method from MyModule'
  end

  def show_module_constants
    puts CONSTANT_VAR1
    puts CONSTANT_VAR2
  end

mc.color = 'my color'
p mc

mc.show_constants
mc.show_module_constants

# puts MyClass.ancestors.find_all { |ac| ac.class == Module }

puts mc.class.included_modules


# module also provides a callback at the event of being included
